if(message != ''):
    for character in message:
        print(character)
```

Open the Terminal window with Ctrl+Shift+`

Run the following command

for line in file:
    print(line)
```

Open the Terminal window with Ctrl+Shift+`

Run the following command

```
py app.py
```

Replace your python code in app.py with the following code
